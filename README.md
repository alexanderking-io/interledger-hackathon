## How it works

Today, most applications charge users a fixed fee regardless of how much they use their services. This model does not accommodate for users who occasionally engage with the app, making the subscription too expensive and not worth it. Our payment platform offers an alternative approach - a flexible pricing model by charging users based on their actual usage of the service. Instead of locking users into a flat monthly or yearly fee, our platform ensures they pay only for the services they actually use. This means the user can stream on multiple platforms without paying full price on any of them.
